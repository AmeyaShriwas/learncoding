Here's an example of how to make a GET request using Axios:\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\naxios.get('https://api.example.com/data')\n  .then(response => console.log(response.data))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error));\n```",
            "Description4": "Learn how to integrate GraphQL into your React Native applications for efficient data fetching and manipulation. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. You can use libraries like Apollo Client or Relay to integrate GraphQL into your React Native app and manage data fetching and caching. Here's an example of how to use Apollo Client to fetch data from a GraphQL server:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';\n\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\n  uri: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',\n  cache: new InMemoryCache()\n});\n\nclient.query({\n  query: gql`query {\n    todos {\n      id\n      title\n    }\n  }`\n})\n  .then(result => console.log(result.data))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error));\n```"
