Reactive forms are built using FormBuilder and FormControl classes to create a form model in the component class. They offer more flexibility and control over form validation and data handling, making them suitable for complex forms with dynamic requirements. For example, you can create a registration form with reactive forms like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';\n\nconstructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {}\n\nregistrationForm = this.fb.group({\n  username: ['', Validators.required],\n  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],\n  password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],\n});\n```",
            "Description3": "Understand form validation in Angular for validating user input and ensuring data integrity in forms. Angular provides built-in validators and allows you to create custom validators to enforce specific validation rules. Form validation can be performed both on the client-side and server-side to provide a seamless user experience and prevent invalid data submission. For example, you can define a custom validator for password confirmation like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AbstractControl, ValidatorFn } from '@angular/forms';\n\nexport function confirmPasswordValidator(control: AbstractControl): ValidatorFn {\n  const password = control.get('password');\n  const confirmPassword = control.get('confirmPassword');\n\n  if (!password || !confirmPassword) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return password.value === confirmPassword.value ? null : { 'passwordMismatch': true };\n}\n```",
