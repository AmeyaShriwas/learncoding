        "HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and layout of a webpage by using a system of tags and attributes to define various elements such as text, images, links, and multimedia.",
        "HTML was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The initial version, HTML 1.0, was very basic and primarily focused on structuring documents with headings, paragraphs, and lists. As the internet evolved, subsequent versions of HTML were released, each introducing new features and capabilities to support the growing complexity of web content and applications. HTML5, the latest version, introduced many new elements and attributes for building modern, interactive web pages.",

        "Nested lists in HTML refer to lists within lists. This means you can have a list item in an ordered or unordered list contain another ordered or unordered list. This creates a hierarchical structure. Nested lists are created by placing one <ol> or <ul> list within another <li> element. Example code:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Item 1</li>\n    <li>Item 2\n        <ul>\n            <li>Subitem 2.1</li>\n            <li>Subitem 2.2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>",
